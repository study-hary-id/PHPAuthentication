# CRUD User with Simple Authentication

This project is a system that allows you to **CRUD** user data, it needs register to use this application.
This is seems so stupid because we can delete other user data, and other users can delete our data too :joy:.
This project is using procedural PHP, jQuery, Bootstrap v4.5.2 and Font Awesome to make it beautiful and responsive.

> I think that isn't beautiful at all :rofl:

> But that's responsive hopefully :sweat_smile:

## :memo: Features

- Register and Login with simple validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS
- Responsive table view to see the user data and do actions to user data
- Change password, view user details, update user data & delete user
